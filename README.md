# TWPL LaTeX class

This class provides the style for submissions to the Toronto Working Papers in Linguistics. 

In order to use the style, you will need to have the `TWPL.cls` file in the same directory as your `.tex` file. I recommend using the `TWPLStyleSheet.tex` file as a starting point for your manuscript, skimming through and seeing how everything is structured in that file, and then substituting your own text where appropriate.
